# R

The first few tutorials introduce R.

1. [Introduction](Introduction.html)
2. [Data types](Data_types.html)
3. [Files](Files.html)

[Exercises](Exercises_1.html)

# More R

Then we go a little further with R's capabilities.

12. Likelihood

# Estimation

Then we look at concepts relevant to estimation.

13. Sampling

15. Bias

# Models

Finally, we introduce the role of models.

# More statistics

Later tutorials assume familiarity with the **Statistics** tutorials, but otherwise cover stand-alone topics and can be consulted in any order:

* [Dimension reduction](Dimension_reduction.html)
* [Likelihood](Likelihood.html)
* [Resampling](Resampling.html)
* [Variants of linear models](Variants_linear_models.html)
